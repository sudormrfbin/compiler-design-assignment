# Pseudo Lang Compiler

Install `make`, and then run the program with `make run`.

## Dependencies

The project depends on the [`datatype99`] library for an implementation
of algebraic data types (ADTs) in pure C to be used to represent and manipulate
the AST concisely. The header files are duplicated under the `include/` directory.
